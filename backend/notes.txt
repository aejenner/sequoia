so I think the easiest way would be to seperate the backend into distinct
modules, with perhaps a shared module for shared functions. An example of a
module might be submitanswer.php which would submit a particular answer.
In this case, many of the modules would be parts of the controller, but
sometimes the view as well.

This might not fit into ishie's shit, so we may need to bundle the various
controller functions together and separate the view functions. It is less
natural to write php this way, but it isn' much harder.

php5 supports OOP very well, almost to the extent of java.

If you are unfamiliar with php, please do not fear. It is very easy to learn.

php.net is a very thorough documentation website for php.
